- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    I donâ€™t need to worry about how the Car handles passenger additions. I guess classes can be used in different contexts without needing to know their internal logic.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    This time, I coded relatively smoothly and bugs were successfully resolved. 
    Advice: work first
